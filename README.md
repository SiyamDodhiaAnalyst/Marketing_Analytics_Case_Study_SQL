# Marketing_Analytics_Case_Study_SQL

Personalized customer emails based off marketing analytics is a winning formula for many digital companies, and this is exactly the initiative that the leadership team at DVD Rental Co has decided to tackle!

In this case study I have been asked to support the customer analytics team at DVD Rentals Co who have been tasked with generating the necessary data points required to populate specific parts of this first-ever customer email campaign. Throughout this marketing case study I will use multiple data manipulation and analysis techniques with the aim to further extend my SQL knowledge. 

The marketing team have shared with us a draft of the email they wish to send out to their customers which can be found [here](). 

To start off this project I needed to understand the data. To do so I used a entity-relationship diagram ("ERD") to highlight which tables from the dataset ([dvd_rentals]()) we should focus on. This can be found [here](). 

The code for this project can be found [here]() with comments throughout to explain my process.
