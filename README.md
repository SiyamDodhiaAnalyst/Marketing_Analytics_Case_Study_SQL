# Marketing_Analytics_Case_Study_SQL

Personalized customer emails based off marketing analytics is a winning formula for many digital companies, and this is exactly the initiative that the leadership team at DVD Rental Co has decided to tackle!

In this case study I have been asked to support the customer analytics team at DVD Rentals Co who have been tasked with generating the necessary data points required to populate specific parts of this first-ever customer email campaign. Throughout this marketing case study I will use multiple data manipulation and analysis techniques with the aim to further extend my SQL knowledge. 

The marketing team have shared with us a draft of the email they wish to send out to their customers which can be found [here](https://github.com/SiyamDodhiaAnalyst/Marketing_Analytics_Case_Study_SQL/blob/main/Additional%20Resources/email%20template.png). 

To start off this project I needed to understand the data. To do so I used a entity-relationship diagram ("ERD") to highlight which tables from the dataset ([dvd_rentals](https://github.com/SiyamDodhiaAnalyst/Marketing_Analytics_Case_Study_SQL/tree/main/dvd_rentals)) we should focus on. This can be found [here](https://github.com/SiyamDodhiaAnalyst/Marketing_Analytics_Case_Study_SQL/blob/main/Additional%20Resources/entity-relationship%20diagram%20gif.gif). 

The code for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/SiyamDodhiaAnalyst/Marketing_Analytics_Case_Study_SQL/blob/main/Marketing%20Analytics%20Case%20Study%20(CODE).txt) with comments throughout to explain my process. 

## Quiz Questions
At the end of this project I was tasked with completing a quiz based off data I had previosuly analysed and tables I had created throughout the project - these questions can also be of interest to the Marketing team:   
1. Which film title was the most recommended for all customers?
2. How many customers were included in the email campaign?
3. Out of all the possible films - what percentage coverage do we have in our recommendations?
4. What is the most popular top category?
5. What is the 4th most popular top category?
6. What is the average percentile ranking for each customer in their top category rounded to the nearest 2 decimal places?
7. What is the cumulative distribution of the top 5 percentile values for the top category from the first_category_insights table rounded to the nearest round percentage?
8. What is the median of the second category percentage of entire viewing history?
9. What is the 80th percentile of films watched featuring each customerâ€™s favourite actor?
10. What was the average number of films watched by each customer?
11. What is the top combination of top 2 categories and how many customers if the order is relevant (e.g. Horror and Drama is a different combination to Drama and Horror)
12. Which actor was the most popular for all customers?
13. How many films on average had customers already seen that feature their favourite actor rounded to closest integer?
14. What is the most common top categories combination if order was irrelevant and how many customers have this combination? (e.g. Horror and Drama is a the same as Drama and Horror)
